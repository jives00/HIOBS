            <p>Global   water activist, Krisanne Baker of Waldoboro, Maine, is a life-long   lover of water; her various works, whether paintings, sculptural   installations, or any of her growing list of experimental/documentary   short films all focus on concerns for water quality, availability, and   water rights. The artist lives on the Medomak River estuary where her   observations of the water and her community further inspire her local   work, as well as her short art documentary videos   on both local and global water issues. Baker researches scientific   findings and cultural reports on water issues to inspire her work; she   hopes to collaborate with scientists on these issues, putting the   visuals in context with the facts. When not in the studio,   Baker teaches environmental art and digital imaging at the University   of Maine at Farmington. She is currently curating her first multimedia   exhibition at UMF in September 2014 titled &ldquo;Hydrologic: Making Sense   With Water.&rdquo;  Baker holds a B.F.A. in Painting,   Rhode Island School of Design; M.F.A. in Ecological Art, Vermont   College of Art<u></u><u></u></p>

            <p>            Kevin  Beers grew up in the Hudson Valley surrounded by the landscape that informed  the Hudson River School genre of American painters. Beers studied at SUNY New  Paltz, but shifted to the Art Students League in New York, where he spent three  years under full scholarship. He spent fourteen years working as an art  director for a major New York advertising agency before he committed himself to  painting full time. Beers spends his winters in Brooklyn and his summers on  Monhegan Island. </p>
            <p>Maine  Magazine has listed Kevin Beers as one the 60 most important artists in Maine. 
              He is  represented by various galleries in Maine and New England including the Banks  Gallery in Portsmouth New Hampshire, the True North Gallery, Kennebunk, Maine,  Gleason Fine Arts, of Camden and Boothbay Harbor, Maine and The Lupine Gallery,  Monhegan Island, Maine. </p>

            <p> Andy  has been painting Maine all his adult life. He is an avid outdoorsman, <em>plein-air</em> painter, sailor, photographer  and primitive woodworker. He is also a highly respected doctor in the Boothbay  region. </p>

            <p><em>&ldquo;I know that we cannot  foresee or choose our future, but we can search through our past and collect  our treasures.&ldquo; </em></p>
            <p>Mary  Bourke grew up on Long Island in a musical and artistic family of nine  children. Her childhood memories inform her work, which she says is &ldquo;about my  place in the world.&rdquo; While her work is rooted in personal experience, Bourke  describes simple scenes of harmony and intimacy that we can all relate to.  Bourke does not work from direct observation but soaks up images, emotions, and  ideas from what she observes, often scenes right beyond her doorstep. Recently,  Bourke has been focusing more on the present—specifically, the seasons—with  figures playing a smaller role relative to the natural environment. Mary Bourke  has a B.A. from Boston College and is represented by Greenhut Galleries. </p>

Cady is nationally known for his shaped canvases that closely follow the  shapes of actual objects. His familiarity with coastal subjects allows Cady to  create icons that show the viewer the world from an acute perspective. Solo  exhibitions include the Mary Ryan Gallery in NYC; Howard Yezerski Gallery in  Boston; Fuji Gallery in Tokyo, Japan; Castelli/Goodman/Solomon Gallery in East  Hampton, New York; and the Caldbeck Gallery.</p>

As part of the wave of New York modernists to explore the  coast of Maine just after the end of the Second World War, Dodd helped to  change the face of painting in the state. She currently lives in New York and  works in Cushing, Maine in the summer.</p>
            <p>From  1971 to 1992, Dodd taught at Brooklyn College, and has, since 1980, served on  the Board of Governors of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture.

I was drawn to shapes, spaces, patterns, and the rhythms of nature. I was  and still am fascinated by the incredible variety of life forms and forces on  this Planet.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p><em>&quot;The light in Maine is  crystal clear, with a sharp-edged clarity and a gem-like quality. I often work  in the morning or late afternoon when these qualities are especially  strong.&quot; - Jill Hoy</em></p>
            <p>Jill  Hoy earned a B.F.A. from the University of California at Santa Cruz and also  attended the New York Academy of Art in New York City. Her work has been  included in numerous solo and group exhibitions around the country and Europe,  and is in over 700 private, corporate and museum collections. Hoy lived and painted  with her husband, Jon Imber, and their son, dividing her time among residences  in Stonington, Maine, Somerville, Massachusetts, and New York City. </p>
            <p>Hoy is  especially interested in composition, light, color, pattern and place. Her  brilliant use of color in the Maine paintings results in surfaces that are  richly and intensely painted, with images that seem to shimmer. Because she's  been a regular resident of the Deer Isle area since 1965, much of her work can  be seen as a document of places and time in the area. The Jill Hoy Gallery in  Stonington is in its 28th year.</p>

The story I tell as a painter is one of how that  particular scene has captured me- how I see beauty in it. At the same time the  painting should look as though it breathes, and has a life of its own.&quot; </em>– Colin Page</p>
            <p>Colin  Page spent his youth in Maryland, and then studied painting at Rhode Island  School of Design and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art,  receiving his B.F.A. in 2000. Ten years  ago he moved to Maine looking for time and space to focus on his painting. He  does the majority of his work outside, working from life to capture the light  and atmosphere of his subject matter. &ldquo;Through painting, I share unexpected  moments of beauty that I find in the space around me. Painting is how I share  the poetry of experience.&rdquo; He recently had solo shows at the Dowling Walsh  Gallery in Rockland, Maine and has participated in numerous group shows  internationally. Recently, Colin Page has also received an award for &ldquo;Artist&rsquo;s  Choice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Honorable Mention&rdquo; at the Maui Plein Air Invitational. </p>

            <p>Greta Van Campen is a painter from  Thomaston, Maine. She comes from a family of artists and grew up painting  beside her mother Susan Headley Van Campen.&nbsp;Greta later continued her  studies in visual art at Bowdoin College. </p>
            <p>Known for her contemporary hard-edged  style, Greta&rsquo;s paintings of intimate and familiar scenes are colorful and bold.  Over the years she has captured not only the rhythm of the Maine coast, but  (over a course of two years,) Van  Campen visited, sketched, photographed and painted all fifty states in the U.S.  Ultimately, Van Campen&rsquo;s paintings offer &ldquo;a glimpse of America.&rdquo; But for the  artist herself, she says, &ldquo;making art is its own reward.&rdquo; Greta has her  home and studio in Maine.</p>

            <p><em>&ldquo;I am trying to capture the  color and shape the first time, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</em> Susan Van Campen<strong></strong></p>
            <p>Susan  Headley Van Campen received her certificate of fine art from the Pennsylvania  Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She also attended the  Moore College of Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Known primarily for her  floral still lifes and lush, rural landscapes Van Campen attempts to capture  &ldquo;things that don&rsquo;t last long—like flowers and skies, water, the sunrise,  clouds, approaching storms, a dandelion, an open tulip just before the petals  fall off.&rdquo; A resident of Thomaston, Maine, Van Campen has exhibited widely  including solo shows at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and Hirschl  &amp; Adler, New York.</p>

          <p>James  Browning Wyeth was born in Wilmington, Delaware, just south of Chadds Ford,  Pennsylvania, where he grew up. &nbsp;Since adolescence he has attracted  considerable attention as a third-generation American artist: son of Andrew  Wyeth, among the country's most popular painters, and the grandson of N.C  Wyeth, famous for his distinctive illustrations for the classics by Stevenson,  Cooper, and Scott. &quot;Everybody in my family paints - excluding possibly the  dogs,&quot; says Jamie Wyeth. At age 65 he now divides his time between Chadds  Ford and Southern Island, Maine. &nbsp;</p></td>
